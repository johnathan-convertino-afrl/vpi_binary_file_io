\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
This library provides two functions.
\begin{itemize}
\item read\_binary\_file(FILE\_NAME, VECTOR)
\item write\_binary\_file(FILE\_NAME, VECTOR)
\end{itemize}
\par
Each instance is a new instance, and will start reading the file from the start.
The vector has to be in size bytes from 1 to any number of bytes. Each function
returns the number of bytes read or writen. Z or X place in the vector indicates
bytes not available for read, or do not write these bytes for write. The read funciton
will return a negative number of bytes when the end of file is reached.

You can use the following to include the library in your project:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=XML]
dep_vpi:
  depend:
    - AFRL:vpi:binary_file_io:1.0.0

targets:
  default: &default
    description: Default file set.
    filesets: [src, dep, dep_vpi]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\section{Architecture}
\par
This VPI library provides two functions for the user to use during simulation, read\_binary\_file and write\_binary\_file. These will read and
write from binary files. These functions use ringbuffers and multithreading to seperate file I/O from the simulation so file access will not
slow down the simulation.
\par
The read\_binary\_file will read any binary file till it runs out of data. When it does, if it can not complete the word (one byte left, for say a 4 byte word output)
then the unused bytes for the aval/bval pairs are set to Z. Meaning in the simulation they will show up as Z, not 0 or 1. It will also assert the EOF (end of file) signal
from the core showing that this is the last of the data.
\par
The write\_binary\_file will write any binary data till it is given that is a 0 or a 1. Any bytes that contain a Z will not be written to the output file. This allows for
any file that is read to be written in a one to one manner.

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information per target.

\section{Building}

\par
The all VPI binary file IO source files are written in C to target the VPI API from Verilog 2001. They should simulate in any modern simulation tool that has VPI support.
The library comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be included in any other testbench. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\par
A barebones test bench for iverilog is included in tb/tb\_vpi.v . This can be run from fusesoc with the following.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ fusesoc run --target=sim AFRL:vpi:binary_file_io:1.0.0
\end{lstlisting}
